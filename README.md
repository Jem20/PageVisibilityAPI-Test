# PageVisibilityAPI-Test
**This is purely just to test the "visibiltychange" event. It isn't meant to be anything advanced.**
Using the page visibility API to determine whether a page is visible or hidden.

* Changes title of the tab to either hidden/visible depending on if the user goes to another page, goes back to the page, etc.
* Logs it inside the console (use inspect element to view the console) to either hidden or visible.
